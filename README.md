# Grammar-Error-Detection

Problem Statement:

Grammatical Error Detection is something that is employed in everyday life. People have begun to use various grammatical tools and chrome extensions like Grammarly to do their activities more conveniently and with more simplicity. This project will undoubtedly target customers who wish to know whether or not their language is grammatically correct. Although such initiatives have been established, they have automatically received a poor score and have not been compared with alternative embedding approaches. As of 2022, we have many embedding techniques and algorithms that can assist us to recognize whether phrases are grammatically accurate in the best way possible. We intend to construct numerous models with different embeddings to compare how well that specific model with that particular embedding could do in solving this challenge.
